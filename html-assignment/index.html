        <h2> My introduction </h2>
        <p>
        As a newcomer, I have arrived in Canada for about three months. Before studying in <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>, I worked as an academic editor in China. This is the 8<sup>th</sup> year since I graduated from school. It has been a long time since I studied and worked in Chinese university. And now I returned to campus life, just in <em>different country</em>. For me, this experience feels both familiar and strange.

        <p>
        When I first arrived in Ottawa, the unfamiliar environment and cuisine frustrated me, as it was my first time traveling abroad alone. I felt lonely and anxious. One night, in the middle of the night, I missed my family deeply. Then, I noticed some comments on my social media account.

        <blockquote>
            Do not hope too much, and also do not disappoint too much. Keep learning, learning, and observing. Allow yourself to make mistakes. --
            <cite>a stranger</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        I had never met this person, nor had I ever spoken to him before. However, his kind words encouraged me to adjust to my new life in Canada. I truly cherish these words.
